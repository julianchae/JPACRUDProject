# JPACRUDProject


### Description:
This project implements JPA and Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations using Spring Boot and DAO

### Implementation:
The user is able to look through a list of objects, add an object of their chosen stats, update previously added objects, and delete objects by ID. The user is also able to look through the database by ID, keyword and name.

### Lessons Learned:
Making this program was a lot easier than the past few weekend project. We have built on a lot of things, and I have noticed that we are converging on much simpler methods for doing everything we have learned. I've learned to better organize my DAOs, and by using JPA, simplify them and shorten them. Using MYSQL Workbench, we are able to better articulate through our database and even create, update and read through them using their program. However this project made me realize that I need to brush up on HTML, CSS and bootstrap. Getting the backend code working is only half of the battle.
